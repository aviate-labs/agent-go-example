# Agent Go Example

This is an example of the [Go Agent](https://github.com/aviate-labs/agent-go) in action.

In this example we will use the agent go fetch transactions from the ICP main network. We will not be using the Rosetta
API in this example, but instead will be using the agent to fetch transactions directly. We will explore the simple CLI
that comes with the agent to generate a client.

This repository contains the end result that is described in the README. If you would like to follow along, you can
